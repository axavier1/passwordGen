# Password Generator

## The Goal
### The goal of this exercise was to take the existing code we were given and use it as a basis for a random password generator.

### In order to accomplish this goal I defined a function to generate a random password based on the inputs I desigend for the user to choose from. This allows for near infinite possible combinations and therefor super secure passwords.
